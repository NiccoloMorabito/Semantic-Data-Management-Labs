# Distributed Graph Lab

This is a hands-on about distributed graphs. We will use Spark GraphX for distributed processing in the Spark ecosystem and, additionally, we will introduce you to the Spark Graph Frames. More information in the Assignment.pdf file.

GraphX is a component of Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation, providing a collection of graph algorithms (e.g., Page Rank, Triangle Counting and Connected Components) and some fundamental operations on graphs based on TLAV. Relevantly, GraphX implements an optimized variant of the Pregel API (most popular implementation of the TLAV programming model), which is a popular graph processing system developed by Google in 2010. Next, we provide the environment setup and then the exercises to be solved.
