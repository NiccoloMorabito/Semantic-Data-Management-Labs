# SEMANTIC DATA MANAGEMENT
## Property Graph Lab

This is a hands-on lab on Property Graphs. We will be using what is, most probably, the most popular property graph database: Neo4j. We will practice how to create and manage graphs, as well as querying/processing them.
For more instructions for setting up the environment and for the list of the exercises to be solved, read the Assignment.pdf file.
