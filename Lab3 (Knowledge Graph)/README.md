# SEMANTIC DATA MANAGEMENT
## Knowledge Graph Lab

This is a hands-on lab on knowledge graphs1. We will use the GraphDB database for working with knowledge graphs. To prepare for the session, you are recommended to get familiar with the RDF Schema vocabulary specification, SPARQL specification and GraphDB manual.

In the Assignment.pdf file, we provide the environment setup and the exercises to be solved.
